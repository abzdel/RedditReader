## TODO
1. build frontend (last step for MVP)
2. host app
3. create sqlite database
    - unique for each user
    - stores history of all previous posts they've requested
4. add functionality - more voices
5. update front-end to:
    - choose between voices
    - choose historical files more cleanly
6. (somewhere during these steps) create architectural diagram. probably after the preceding steps, but after creating sqlite database at the earliest
